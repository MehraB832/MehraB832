## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am an aspiring developer who has recently focused on the Linux operating system.
I love learning and practicing new languages â€‹â€‹and I have experience in backend, web and android development with different languages. I am proficient in PHP and Java, but I am also familiar with other languages â€‹â€‹and technologies.

In addition to programming, I have other skills. The ability to reverse engineer some Android applications and do things like bug bunty and Dos and Ddos attacks is part of my experience. Linux is my work environment and I feel comfortable and strong in it.

To contact me, please send me an email, as I am not on social media.
